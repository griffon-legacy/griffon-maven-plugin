How should I setup my environment to use the griffon plugin ?

  <<Pre-requisites>> : 
  
  * Griffon must be installed locally and the environment variable Griffon_HOME set.
  
  * This plugin is compatible with maven 2.0.5+. 
  
  * This plugin is compatible with griffon 0.9.4+.
  
* Setup to use a released version
  
  Because our groupId isn't referenced by maven to be a plugin groupId (by default maven knows only 
  org.apache.maven.plugins and org.codehaus.mojo) you have to add it in your user's settings 
  (~/.m2/settings.xml) :
  
+-------+
<settings>
  ...  
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>org.codehaus.griffon</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>
  ...
</settings>
+-------+
  
  To use the plugin you just have to launch :
  
+-------+
  mvn griffon:<a goal>
+-------+
  
* Setup to use a snapshot version

  To use a snapshot version of the plugin, in addition of the settings explained on top you also have to had in your settings
  a profile with our repositories to download the plugin and its dependencies.

+-------+  
<settings>
  ...  
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>mtg</id>
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>mtg.snapshots</id>
          <name>Forge Snapshot Repository</name>
          <url>http://forge.octo.com/archiva/repository/mtg-snapshots</url>
          <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
          </releases>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
      <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
          <id>mtg.snapshots</id>
          <name>Forge Snapshot Repository</name>
          <url>http://forge.octo.com/archiva/repository/mtg-snapshots</url>
          <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
          </releases>
        </pluginRepository>
      </pluginRepositories>
    </profile>
   </profiles>  
  ...
</settings>
+-------+
  
  You can activate this profile permanently in your settings

+-------+
<settings>
  ...
  <activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>mtg</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
  ...
</settings>
+-------+
  
  Or just when necessary with the command line parameter   

+-------+
  mvn -Pmtg <A goal|A phase>
+-------+
  
  To use the snapshot version of the plugin you can declare it in your project POM or you can use the long syntax to call the plugin :
  
+-------+
  mvn com.octo.mtg:griffon-maven-plugin:<x.x>-SNAPSHOT:<A Goal>
+-------+
