    Create a Griffon Project

How can I create a griffon application from Maven ?

  Just by launching :
  
+------+
  mvn griffon:create-app
+------+

  <<By default the application is created with a version set to 1.0 in the application.properties file. To follow maven conventions, it's better to replace it by 1.0-SNAPSHOT.>>
  
Why didn't you deliver an archetype for Griffon applications ?

  Because Griffon evolves really quickly and it could be a big consumption of time to maintain this artifact for each new release of Griffon.
