How can I <"mavenize"> a newly created project or an existing one ?
 
  To <"mavenize"> a Griffon project you have to create in its root directory a POM.
  To ease this step we created a goal to create it for you. You just have to define a groupId for your project.
  
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
mvn griffon:create-pom -DgroupId=com.mycompany
